What is Pelagius?
---------------
Pelagius is a Discord bot that was originally written for Evertiro's LOTD Plus
Skyrim modding guide (lotdplus.com). This later expanded to Lexy's Legacy of the
Dragonborn guide (lexyslotd.com) as well as The Phoenix Flavour (thephoenixflavour.com).
Originally, the wasn't actually a bot at all, just me running a python script
manually to compare my own loadorder to that of other users when they uploaded it.
Naturally, the problem with that is that I have to be there all the time to run
my script. I then decided to start developing a standalone Discord bot written
in Discord.py to accomplish the same thing, but automatically. I later switched
over to Discord.js, as well as implemented a few other features, such as being
able to ignore certain plugins in the list. However, that's the past. Let's talk
about now and the future.

What does it do?
---------------
At its current stage, the bot doesn't actually do much of anything really.
The owner of a server is by default the only one the bot considers "staff," who
can then add and remove other staff. Staff members are able to add and remove
"approved" channels, as well as list them. And that's it. It currently doesn't
do anything else. But I have big plans for the future, starting with implementing
the functionality of the last bot (that is currently still running).

* Staff upload a "master" loadorder.txt to be compared to (generated by MO2)
* Users can upload a loadorder.txt and it will be analyzed
* * This analysis will tell them what plugins they shouldn't have and what they're missing
    compared to the master list
* * A new feature will be that it will also compare the actual order of the plugins
    by using LOOT rules
* * * Not quite sure yet how I'll be implementing this feature
* Staff can pause and resume validation, useful for updates to the list
* Staff can upload a "skips" file which contains a list of plugins to ignore
* Staff can upload a "reasons" JSON file which is used to tell users why a certain
  plugin is missing or extra
* * A potential expansion on this would be to automatically web scrape some of this info
* Old versions of uploaded staff files are automatically archived
* Properly supports multiple Discord servers, keeping staff lists and master files separate

Necessary setup for development testing
----------------
Create a file ".env" in the same directory as pelagius.js
In that file, add the line
BOT_TOKEN="{your token}"
Where {your token} is the token found on the bot section of your application

Install the npm packages "discord.js" and "dotenv"
