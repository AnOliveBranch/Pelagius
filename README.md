What is Pelagius?
---------------
Pelagius is a Discord bot that was originally written for Evertiro's LOTD Plus
Skyrim modding guide (lotdplus.com). This later expanded to Lexy's Legacy of the
Dragonborn guide (lexyslotd.com) as well as The Phoenix Flavour (thephoenixflavour.com).
Originally, the wasn't actually a bot at all, just me running a python script
manually to compare my own loadorder to that of other users when they uploaded it.
Naturally, the problem with that is that I have to be there all the time to run
my script. I then decided to start developing a standalone Discord bot written
in Discord.py to accomplish the same thing, but automatically. I later switched
over to Discord.js, as well as implemented a few other features, such as being
able to ignore certain plugins in the list. However, that's the past. Let's talk
about now and the future.

What does it do?
---------------
Basically it lets your users upload a loadorder.txt file and compare it to a master file.

* Staff upload a "master" loadorder.txt to be compared to (generated by MO2)
* Users can upload a loadorder.txt and it will be analyzed
* * This analysis will tell them what plugins they shouldn't have and what they're missing
    compared to the master list
* Staff can pause and resume validation, useful for updates to the list
* Staff can upload a "skips" file which contains a list of plugins to ignore
* Staff can upload a "reasons" JSON file which is used to tell users why a certain
  plugin is missing or extra
* Old versions of uploaded staff files are automatically archived
* Properly supports multiple Discord servers, keeping staff lists and master files separate

How do I set it up?
---------------
First, go to this link: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=714232981774139442&permissions=100352&scope=bot
This will bring up a page that allows you to select a server to add the bot to. It will ask for permissions to send messages, attach files, and read message history.
Then, click "Authorize"
Once the bot has joined the server, you need to do a couple of things.

If you're not the server owner, you'll need to be added as "staff" for the bot.
* Have the server owner run the command '!loadorder staff add [@Yourname]'

You'll need at least one channel in which the bot is allowed to check load order.
* Go to that channel, and run the command '!loadorder channel add'

Then, you need a master file
* Get your loadorder.txt ([example](example/loadorder.txt)) (generated by MO2) and upload it with the message '!loadorder file update loadorder'

And that's it, it's ready to run!

If you want, you can also upload a "skips" and "reasons" file.
The skips file ([example](example/skips.txt)) will ignore all filenames listed on it (line-separated).
The reasons file ([example](example/reasons.json)) will provide reasons to your users as to why they shouldn't have a certain file (it needs to be in JSON).

I also suggest setting the loadorder path so your users know where to get the loadorder.txt file.
To do this, run '!loadorder settings path [your path]'

Necessary setup for development testing
----------------
Create a file ".env" in the same directory as pelagius.js
In that file, add the line
BOT_TOKEN="{your token}"
Where {your token} is the token found on the bot section of your application

Install the node packages "discord.js", "dotenv", "fs", and "https"
